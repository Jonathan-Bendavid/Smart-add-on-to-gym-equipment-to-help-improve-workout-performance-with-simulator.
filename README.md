Smart add on to gym equipment to help improve workout performance and a dedicated simulator.
This project simulates a smart add-on for existing gym equipment. It utilizes distance sensors and load (weight) to gather real-time mechanical data, such as range of motion and applied force directly from fitness machines. A motorized piston is used to simulate muscle movement. The system calculates data like power output, range of motion and different scores based on physical measurements. An ESP32 microcontroller uses MicroPython to handle backend logic and communicates with a Firebase Realtime Database. User interaction is via NFC (RFID). The device automatically logs user workout sessions and data, tracking workouts and provides performance analysis and benchmarks. 
Technologies used: Python (micropython), REST API (HTTP POST/PUT/PATCH requests, Firebase), Firebase Realtime Database.
 Working with different hardware: RFID, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, Weight Sensor (HX711 module), Motor, LCD Display (I2C).
